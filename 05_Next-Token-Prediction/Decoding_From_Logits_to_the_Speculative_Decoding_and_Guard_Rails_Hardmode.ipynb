        "Top-P sampling, also known as nucleus sampling, is a text generation technique that provides a balance between diversity and quality in the generated text. It works as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Sorting probabilities**: After the model produces the probability distribution for the next token, the probabilities are sorted in descending order.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Cumulative sum**: A cumulative sum of these sorted probabilities is calculated.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Probability mass selection**: A threshold p (typically between 0.9 and 1) is chosen. The smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds p is selected.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Sampling**: The next token is randomly sampled from this reduced set of tokens.\n",

        "\n",
        "Beam search is a heuristic search algorithm commonly used in natural language processing for text generation tasks. It's an extension of greedy decoding that explores multiple possible sequences simultaneously.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key concepts:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Beam width**: The number of sequences to keep track of at each step.\n",
        "2. **Expanding**: At each step, generate all possible next tokens for each sequence in the beam.\n",
        "3. **Pruning**: Keep only the top-k sequences (where k is the beam width) based on their cumulative probability scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "Algorithm overview:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Start with an initial sequence (usually a start token).\n",
        "2. Generate the next token probabilities for each sequence in the beam.\n",
        "3. Create new candidate sequences by appending each possible next token.\n",
        "4. Score each candidate sequence based on its cumulative log probability.\n",
        "5. Select the top-k sequences to form the new beam.\n",
        "6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the desired length is reached or a stop condition is met."

        "3. Accept/Reject Process:\n",
